## Overview
The goal of the project assignment is to predict the exercise manner categories from the sampl exercise training data. 
The variable name for prediction is "classe" and the other variables are used to predict "classe" value.
This report describes the steps to built the model, cross validation steps and the expected out of sample error.

## Defining Error Rate
There is no specific requirement for prediction accuracy rate. However, lets set an prediction eror rate to be less than 5%.

## Load and split data for validation
The data loaded from the two .csv files provided. Followind is the R code for loading the data. 

Following is the code for validation data set.

## Select features/variables

The dataset contains 160 variable including the prediction variable. The following analysis has been performed to identify the appropriate variables.

## Define the Model
After exploratory analysis, it is evident that the problem is related to clustering problem and looks the method random forest can be used for the model.
